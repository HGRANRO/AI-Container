# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Artificial intelligence container for waste reception: a container that advises the customer by identifying the waste and instructing the customer in the container. Operates hazardous waste reception in sparsely populated areas


## Background


* I work in the waste industry and services should be closer to the customer
* Reception of hazardous waste also outside urban areas
* With the help of artificial intelligence, the customer will hopefully act responsibly in the container



## How is it used?

The customer receives a code from the waste facility that allows transactions in the container. The customer can take, for example, oils or other hazardous waste to the container free of charge. The container advises the customer by speech.
